Covid-19 Project

This will look at the data provided by Kaggle.

I'll fill more on this later as I looked at the dataset to see what needs to
be wrangled and what kind of analysis I want to do on this.  After that,  I
plan to do some visualizations on the data.

This will be a ongoing thing to do in my spare time outside of work and
going through the Data Analytics Flex course on Thinkful.  This will use
the skills I picked up at Udacity.
